The app was very successful, garnering over 200,000 downloads on the Play Store and generating approximately $1,000 in ad revenue. Unfortunately, it was eventually removed by Google due to lack of maintenance, and the source code was lost during a Unity migration.",

As a gamer with instant replay enabled, I accumulated many 5-minute clips containing only 30 seconds of valuable content. Processing these clips individually was time-consuming, so I created this solution. I extensively used GPT-4o with Copilot to build this in Flutter (a technology I had no prior knowledge of), which provided an opportunity to learn the limitations and benefits of using LLMs for development.",
